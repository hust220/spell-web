	<b>SPELL</b> is an acronym for <b>S</b>plit <b>P</b>rotein Reass<b>e</b>mbly by <b>L</b>igands or <b>L</b>ight.
	<b>SPELL</b> server predicts potential split sites in proteins such that two halves of a splitted protein being 
        attached to a couple of other proteins (that dimerize upon ligand or light stimulation) can reassemble into 
        a full protein upon ligand or light stimulation. The server ranges potential split sites according to the degree of prediction reliability.
