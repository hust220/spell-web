By default, the backbone and CB atoms of all amino acids are constrained during relaxation. This option allows you to restrain motion of all sidechain atoms that are not involved in a steric clash. Setting this option might be useful especially when sidechain rotamers of surface aminoacids are critical and have already been optimized.<br/><br/>
Please see documentation to learn more about this option.
