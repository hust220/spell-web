<h3><a>What is Gaia?</a></strong></h3>
<div>
	<p>Gaia, named after the Greek personification of mother nature, is a tool to estimate the quality of a given protein structure in comparison against high-resolution crystal structures. The parameters used in quality estimates include steric-clashes, unsatisfied hydrogen-bond partners, packing artifacts (voids), solvent accessible surface area and the covalent geometry of the protein structure.</p>

<h3><a href="#">What is a steric clash?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>Any atomic overlap resulting in Van der Waal&#39;s repulsion energy greater than 0.3 kcal/mol (0.5 k<sub>B</sub>T) except in the following cases:<ol><li>When the atoms are bonded</li><li>When the atoms form a hydrogen bond (The heavy atoms involved in the hydrogen bond, we assign the Van der Waal&#39;s radius of hydrogen to be zero)</li><li>When the atoms involved are backbone atoms and have separation of 2 residues.</li></ol> The Van der Waal&#39;s repulsion energy is calculated using CHARMM non-bonded  parameters, which are identical to CNS parameters except for carboxyl oxygens.</p>

<h3><a href="#">How do you define unsatisfied hydrogen-bonding partners?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>Hydrogen bonds are essential anchors that stabilize a folded protein. Even though the exact balance of the energetics of hydrogen bonds between polar atoms in proteins compared to the hydrogen bonds between polar atoms and solvent is debated, in the absence of the solvent in the protein core, any polar atom that does not form a hydrogen bond would destabilize the protein. Absence of secondary structural elements in the core or the presence of polar sidechains leads to unsatisfied hydrogen bonding partners (considering surface polar atoms to form hydrogen bonds with solvent). We define a polar nitrogen/oxygen atom as an unsatisfied hydrogen bond donor/acceptor if it is buried from the solvent and is not involved in a hydrogen bond. If a polar atom belongs to a residue whose total SASA is zero, it is marked as buried. On the other hand, if the polar atom itself is buried, but the residue it belongs to features a non-zero SASA, rotamer changes/side chain dynamics could expose the polar atom, and thus, the polar atom is classified as being in the shell: an intermediate layer between buried and solvent accessible regions of the protein. We measure unsatisfied hydrogen bonds as the percentage of total polar atoms that do not form hydrogen bonds in i) buried region of the protein and ii) shell region of the protein. The percentage of unsatisfied hydrogen bond partners in the buried region of a protein across our dataset fits to a Gaussian distribution centered at 0.14 with a standard deviation of 1.3, indicating 84% of the proteins in our dataset feature less than 1.44 % polar atoms that do not form hydrogen bonds (Figure 3a). Similarly, in the shell region, we observe 7.5 &plusmn; 2 % of the total polar atoms that do not form hydrogen bonds (Figure 3b). In the absence of hydrogen bonding partners, polar atoms in the buried regions can form hydrogen bonds with buried structural waters. Since we use high-resolution structures in our datasets, most of structural waters in these structures are expected to be resolved. Hence we ask the question: what is the influence of buried waters in lowering the number of polar unsatisfied atoms, thus stabilizing the protein. We observe that for buried polar atoms, the percentage of unsatisfied polar atoms decreases from 0.14 &plusmn; 1.3 to -0.08 &plusmn; 0.95, when hydrogen bonds to buried structural waters are considered. Similarly, for shell region, the percentage of polar atoms decreases from 7.5 &plusmn; 2 to 4.8 &plusmn; 2. Thus, structural waters make a significant contribution in forming hydrogen bonds in the shell and buried regions of the protein.</p>

<h3><a href="#">How do you calculate solvent accessible surface area (SASA)?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>We define the SASA of a protein as the area covered by the center of a solvent sphere, as it rolls over the protein surface. Considering the radius of the solvent sphere to be 1.4, we can obtain SASA by calculating the surface area of the protein, when the radii of all its atoms are increased by 1.4. We use the method originally developed by LeGrand and Merz for calculating SASA. Briefly, Boolean masks are used and we use 1024 dots on the surface of each atom. We calculated SASA of our high-resolution structures and observe that the SASA scales as a function of chain length (N), N<sup>0.74</sup>. Thus, when the total SASA for all structures are normalized by the factor (chain length)<sup>-0.74</sup>, we observe the mean SASA / (chain length)<sup>0.74</sup> as 195.1 &plusmn; 14.5 &Aring;<sup>2</sup>.</p>

<h3><a href="#">How do you define/detect voids in proteins?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>We define void volume as the volume of the free space inside a protein that is not accessible to solvent. Voids in proteins are thermodynamically unfavorable, because of the work done in creating vacuum in the protein core, PV. Here, P is the pressure and V is the total volume of the voids inside a protein. To identify the voids in a protein, we first use the method of LeGrand and Merz, to obtain all the dots on the surface of each atom that is not buried by other atoms. These exposed dots could either belong to the surface or internal voids in the protein. Performing single linkage clustering on these exposed dots would yield one large cluster corresponding to the solvent accessible surface and several small clusters corresponding to the internal voids. We use distance between dots for performing single linkage clustering. After identification of the internal voids, we calculate the volume of each of these voids by numerical integration: we iteratively increment the radii of all the atoms forming the void by 0.01 &Aring; and sum up the surface area of these voids times 0.01 at each increment till the area converges to zero. To estimate the error in integration to calculate void volumes, we constructed a toy-model consisting of a cube whose surface is completely lined with spheres and whose void volume can be determined analytically. Performing our void identification on this model would separate the internal and external surfaces of the cube. By calculating the void volume using our integration method on the toy model, we can estimate the error in our integration. Since active sites of some enzymes could be identified as voids, we divided our dataset into enzymes and non-enzymes to observe if enzymes on average have larger voids compared to non-enzymes. We first examine the distribution of the total void volume of a protein, which is a sum of the volumes of all the voids in a protein. To avoid bias due to size of the protein, we divide the total void volume by its chain length (number of amino acids), which is proportional to the total volume of the protein. We observe that both enzymes and non-enzymes mostly prefer a total void-volume of nearly zero. The rest of the points follow an exponentially decreasing distribution, with enzymes on an average having larger total void volume compared to non-enzymes. The difference in total void-volume distribution of enzymes and non-enzymes, we infer that several of the active sites may be buried. The fact that most proteins prefer no voids reiterates that voids are unfavorable structural anomalies. Further, an exponential decay of the probability of a given total void volume suggests a Poisson distribution: finding voids in protein cores is a rare event. In order to examine the range of voids that are observed in proteins, we next plot the distribution of the volume of all individual voids detected in our dataset. We observe that the distribution of voids can be fit with an exponential function each for lower and higher void volumes respectively. The lower values of void volumes are identical for enzymes and non-enzymes, reflecting non-active site voids. The probability of finding larger voids is slightly higher for enzymes. From the distribution, we infer that the penalty for forming smaller voids is much more than for forming larger voids as observed from the difference in the slope of the two distributions. Interestingly, the transition point from smaller voids to larger voids occurs at &tilde;11.5 &Aring;<sup>3</sup>, which is close to the molecular volume of water (assuming water radius to be 1.4 &Aring;). Thus, these distributions suggest that voids larger than the size of a water molecule are less unfavorable compared to voids smaller than a water molecule.</p>

<h3><a href="#">How did you arrive at the &#39;acceptable&#39; scores for each parameter?</a></h3>
<div>
	<p>We obtain high-resolution (0-2.5&Aring; resolution) protein structures determined only using X-ray crystallographic techniques from the PDB database that were at least 25 residues long and do not contain biomolecules other than proteins (such as ligands/DNA/RNA). We also exclude structures that contain modified residues except selenomethionine (which we replace with methionine using Medusa). Since we are interested in the properties of globular chains only and not interfaces, the structures are split into individual peptide chains and clustered based on sequence similarity. We consider only one representative chain from each cluster of sequences that are at least 80% similar to each other. To filter out structures that were extremely non-globular, we used an Rg scaling cut-off of 0.66. We filtered out structures whose Rg scaled by more than L0.66, where L is the number of amino acids in the protein. For well packed globular proteins, we found the scaling factor to be 0.36. The final dataset consists of 3971 single chains. We use Medusa (Ding and Dokholyan, 2006; Yin, et al., 2007) to accurately place any missing side-chain atoms in these structures. Of the 3971 structures used, 1725 are enzymes as determined using GO annotation (catalytic activity) or the presence of an EC number in the header of the PDB file. The final list of PDB and chain IDs are provided as a table that can be downloaded by clicking <a href="">here</a>.</p>
	<p>Using the distributions obtained from our high-resolution dataset, we report a p-value for the input protein structure (the p-value indicates the fraction of structures with a score worse than the input structure). A p-value lower than 0.05 indicates that the input structure is in need of further refinement.</p>
