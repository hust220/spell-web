HMGB1a in particular exhibits higher binding affinity to CP-GG adducts, and the extent of discrimination between CP- and OX-GG adducts is dependent on the bases flanking the adducts. However, the structural basis for this differential binding is not known. Here, we show that the conformational dynamics of CP- and OX-GG adducts are distinct and depend on the sequence context of the adduct. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Pt-GG adducts in the TGGA sequence context revealed that even though the major conformations of CP- and OX-GG adducts were similar, the minor conformations were distinct. Using the pattern of hydrogen bond formation between the Pt-ammines and the adjacent DNA bases, we identified the major and minor conformations sampled by Pt-DNA. We found that the minor conformations sampled exclusively by the CP-GG adduct exhibit structural properties that favor binding by HMGB1a, which may explain its higher binding affinity to CP-GG adducts, while these conformations are not sampled by OX-GG adducts because of the constraints imposed by its cyclohexane ring, which may explain the negligible binding affinity of HMGB1a for OX-GG adducts in the TGGA sequence context. Based on these results, we postulate that the constraints imposed by the cyclohexane ring of OX affect the DNA conformations explored by OX-GG adduct compared to those of CP-GG adduct, which may influence the binding affinities of HMG-domain proteins for Pt-GG adducts, and that these conformations are further influenced by the DNA sequence context of the Pt-GG adduct.'),(688,'tldpkdd_jbc09','Torres, M.

Whereas mono-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is targeted to the vacuole, poly-ubiquitinated Gpa1 is directed instead to the proteasome. Here we investigate the structural requirements for mono- and poly-ubiquitination of Gpa1. We find that variants of Gpa1 engineered to be unstable are more likely to be poly-ubiquitinated and less likely to be mono-ubiquitinated. In addition, mutants that cannot be myristoylated are no longer mono-ubiquitinated but are still polyubiquitinated. Finally, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 is necessary for Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination <i>in vivo</i> and that the purified enzyme is sufficient to catalyze Gpa1 mono-ubiquitination <i>in vitro</i>. Taken together, these data indicate that mono- and poly-ubiquitination have distinct enzyme and substrate recognition requirements; whereas poly-ubiquitination targets misfolded protein for degradation, a distinct ubiquitination apparatus targets the fully mature, fully myristoylated G protein for mono-ubiquitination and delivery to the vacuole.'),(682,'pxccdb_mcp09','Petrotchenko, E.

However, unambiguous mass spectrometric identification of cross-linked peptides derived from proteolytically digested cross-linked proteins is still challenging. Here we describe the use of a novel cross-linker, bimane bisthiopropionic acid Nsuccinimidyl ester (BiPS), that overcomes many of the challenges associated with other cross-linking reagents. BiPS is distinguished from other cross-linkers by a unique combination of properties: it is photocleavable, fluorescent, homobifunctional, amine-reactive, and isotopically coded. As demonstrated with a model protein complex, RNase S, the fluorescent moiety of BiPS allows for sensitive and specific monitoring of the different cross-linking steps, including detection and isolation of cross-linked proteins by gel electrophoresis, determination of in-gel digestion completion, and fluorescence-based separation of cross-linked peptides by HPLC. The isotopic coding of BiPS results in characteristic ion signal &quot;doublets&quot; in mass spectra, thereby permitting ready detection of cross-linker-containing peptides. Under MALDI-MS conditions, partial photocleavage of the cross-linker occurs, releasing the crosslinked peptides. This allows differentiation between dead-end, intra-, and interpeptide cross-links based on losses of specific mass fragments. It also allows the use of the isotope doublets as mass spectrometric &quot;signatures.&quot; A software program was developed that permits automatic cross-link identification and assignment of the cross-link type. Furthermore photocleavage of BiPS assists in cross-link identification by allowing separate tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of each peptide comprising the original cross-link. By combining the use of BiPS with MS, we have provided the first direct evidence for the docking site of a phosphorylated G-protein coupled receptor C terminus on the multifunctional adaptor protein &beta;-arrestin, clearly demonstrating the broad potential and application of this novel cross-linker in structural and cellular biology.'),(683,'mpyrdt_psfb09','Meissner, G., Pasek, D.

We consider a general two-headed model for cytoplasmic dynein that is built from experimental measurements on the chemomechanical states of monomeric dynein. We explore different possible scenarios of coordination that simultaneously satisfy two main requirements of the dimeric protein: high processivity (long run length) and high motor velocity (fast ATP turnover). To demonstrate the interplay between these requirements and the necessity for coordination, we first develop and analyze a simple mechanical model for the force-induced stepping in the absence of ATP. Next we use a simplified model of dimeric dynein&#146;s chemomechanical cycle to establish the kinetic rules that must be satisfied for the model to be consistent with recent data for the motor&#146;s performance from single molecule experiments.

In contrast, both dimers and trimers, formed by reduced &beta;2m, are comprised of parallel &beta;-sheets between monomers and stabilized by the hydrogen bond network along the backbone. The oligomerized monomers are in extended conformations, capable of further aggregation. We find that both reduced and oxidized dimers are thermodynamically less stable than their corresponding monomers, indicating that &beta;2m oligomerization is not accompanied by the formation of a thermodynamically stable dimer. Our studies suggest that the different aggregation pathways of oxidized and reduced &beta;2m are dictated by the formation of distinct precursor oligomeric species that are modulated by Cys25-Cys80 disulfide-bonds.

In molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type SOD1 and three structurally diverse FALS mutants (A4V, G37R, and H46R), we find that a common effect of mutations on SOD1 dimer is the mutation-induced disruption of dynamic coupling between monomers. In the wild-type dimer, the principal coupled motion corresponds to a &quot;breathing motion&quot; of the monomers around an axis parallel to the dimer interface, and an opening-closing motion of the distal metal-binding loops. These coupled motions are disrupted in all three mutants independent of the mutation location. Loss of coupled motions in mutant dimers occurs with increased disruption of a key stabilizing structural element (the &beta;-plug) leading to the de-protection of edge strands. To rationalize disruption of coupling, which is independent of the effect of the mutation on global SOD1 stability, we analyze the residue–residue interaction network formed in SOD1. We find that the dimer interface and metal-binding loops, both involved in coupled motions, are regions of high connectivity in the network.

Twenty-five 10 ns unrestrained fully solvated molecular dynamics simulations were performed starting from two different DNA conformations using AMBER v8.0.

In addition, our data show that these differences in hydrogen bond formation are strongly correlated with differences in conformational dynamics, specifically the fraction of time spent in different DNA conformations in the vicinity of the adduct, for CP- and OX-DNA adducts.

To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD1 folding, we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide reduced environments in computational simulations.

The disulfide bond anchors a loop (Glu-49 to Asn-53) that contributes to the dimer interface. The reduction of the disulfide bond in SOD1 with metal ions depleted results in a flexible Glu-49-Asn-53 loop, which, in turn, disrupts dimer formation. Interestingly, the disulfide bond reduction does not affect the thermostability of monomer SOD1 as significantly as the metal ions do. We further study the structural dynamics of metal-free SOD1 monomers, the precursor for aggregation, in simulations and find inhomogeneous local unfolding of &beta;-strands.

HMGB1a in particular exhibits higher binding affinity to CP-GG adducts, and the extent of discrimination between CP- and OX-GG adducts is dependent on the bases flanking the adducts. However, the structural basis for this differential binding is not known. Here, we show that the conformational dynamics of CP- and OX-GG adducts are distinct and depend on the sequence context of the adduct. Molecular dynamics simulations of the Pt-GG adducts in the TGGA sequence context revealed that even though the major conformations of CP- and OX-GG adducts were similar, the minor conformations were distinct. Using the pattern of hydrogen bond formation between the Pt-ammines and the adjacent DNA bases, we identified the major and minor conformations sampled by Pt-DNA. We found that the minor conformations sampled exclusively by the CP-GG adduct exhibit structural properties that favor binding by HMGB1a, which may explain its higher binding affinity to CP-GG adducts, while these conformations are not sampled by OX-GG adducts because of the constraints imposed by its cyclohexane ring, which may explain the negligible binding affinity of HMGB1a for OX-GG adducts in the TGGA sequence context. Based on these results, we postulate that the constraints imposed by the cyclohexane ring of OX affect the DNA conformations explored by OX-GG adduct compared to those of CP-GG adduct, which may influence the binding affinities of HMG-domain proteins for Pt-GG adducts, and that these conformations are further influenced by the DNA sequence context of the Pt-GG adduct.'),(303,'tldpkdd_jbc09','Torres, M.

Here we describe the use of a novel cross-linker, bimane bisthiopropionic acid Nsuccinimidyl ester (BiPS), that overcomes many of the challenges associated with other cross-linking reagents. BiPS is distinguished from other cross-linkers by a unique combination of properties: it is photocleavable, fluorescent, homobifunctional, amine-reactive, and isotopically coded. As demonstrated with a model protein complex, RNase S, the fluorescent moiety of BiPS allows for sensitive and specific monitoring of the different cross-linking steps, including detection and isolation of cross-linked proteins by gel electrophoresis, determination of in-gel digestion completion, and fluorescence-based separation of cross-linked peptides by HPLC. The isotopic coding of BiPS results in characteristic ion signal &quot;doublets&quot; in mass spectra, thereby permitting ready detection of cross-linker-containing peptides. Under MALDI-MS conditions, partial photocleavage of the cross-linker occurs, releasing the crosslinked peptides. This allows differentiation between dead-end, intra-, and interpeptide cross-links based on losses of specific mass fragments. It also allows the use of the isotope doublets as mass spectrometric &quot;signatures.&quot; A software program was developed that permits automatic cross-link identification and assignment of the cross-link type. Furthermore photocleavage of BiPS assists in cross-link identification by allowing separate tandem mass spectrometry sequencing of each peptide comprising the original cross-link.

We observed a critical temperature, below which the peptide folds into a.dd &alpha;-helical coiled-coil state and above which the peptide misfolds into &beta;-rich structures with a high propensity to aggregate. The structures adopted by this peptide during low temperature simulations have a backbone root mean square deviation less than 2 A from the crystal structure. At high temperatures, this peptide adopts an amyloid-like structure, which is mainly composed of coiled anti-parallel &beta;-sheets with the cross-&beta;-signature of amyloid fibrils. Most strikingly, we observed conformational conversions in which an &alpha;-helix is converted into a &beta;-strand by proximate stable &beta;-sheets with exposed hydrophobic surfaces and unsaturated hydrogen bonds. Our study suggested a possible generic molecular mechanism of the template-mediated aggregation process, originally proposed by Prusiner (Prusiner, S. B. (1998) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type SOD1 and three structurally diverse FALS mutants (A4V, G37R, and H46R), we find that a common effect of mutations on SOD1 dimer is the mutation-induced disruption of dynamic coupling between monomers. In the wild-type dimer, the principal coupled motion corresponds to a &quot;breathing motion&quot; of the monomers around an axis parallel to the dimer interface, and an opening-closing motion of the distal metal-binding loops. These coupled motions are disrupted in all three mutants independent of the mutation location. Loss of coupled motions in mutant dimers occurs with increased disruption of a key stabilizing structural element (the &beta;-plug) leading to the de-protection of edge strands. To rationalize disruption of coupling, which is independent of the effect of the mutation on global SOD1 stability, we analyze the residue–residue interaction network formed in SOD1. We find that the dimer interface and metal-binding loops, both involved in coupled motions, are regions of high connectivity in the network.

Essential dynamics analysis of simulation trajectories shows that bending across the H3-H3 is a prominent mode of intranucleosomal dynamics. We postulate that effects of salts on mononucleosomes can be modeled in discrete molecular dynamics by modulating histone-DNA interaction potentials.

To uncover the role of metals and the disulfide bond in the SOD1 folding, we systemically study the folding thermodynamics and structural dynamics of SOD1 monomer and dimer with and without metal binding and under disulfide-intact or disulfide reduced environments in computational simulations. We use all-atom discrete molecular dynamics for sampling. Our simulation results provide dynamical evidence to the stabilizing role of metal ions in both dimer and monomer SOD1. The disulfide bond anchors a loop (Glu-49 to Asn-53) that contributes to the dimer interface. The reduction of the disulfide bond in SOD1 with metal ions depleted results in a flexible Glu-49-Asn-53 loop, which, in turn, disrupts dimer formation. Interestingly, the disulfide bond reduction does not affect the thermostability of monomer SOD1 as significantly as the metal ions do. We further study the structural dynamics of metal-free SOD1 monomers, the precursor for aggregation, in simulations and find inhomogeneous local unfolding of &beta;-strands.

Here we report a direct observation and characterization of the TSE by molecular dynamic folding simulations of the C-Src SH3 domain, a small protein that has been extensively studied experimentally.

Using two small, well characterized proteins, CI2 and C-Src SH3, we show how topological properties of protein conformations determine their kinetic ability to fold. We use a macroscopic measure of the protein contact network topology, the average graph connectivity, by constructing graphs that are based on the geometry of protein conformations. We find that the average connectivity is higher for conformations with a high folding probability than for those with a high probability to unfold.

To identify the basis for isoform specific functionality, we perform an evolutionary trace of chordate filamin at the granularity of single residues. Our trace methodology is constrained to focus on neo-functionality by requiring that one isoform remain the ancestral type while at least one isoform has an accepted mutation. We call divergence meeting these characteristics \"class-distinctive.\" To obtain a temporal and spatial context for class-distinctive residues, we derive an all-atom model of full-length filamin A by homology modeling and joining individual domains. We map onto our model both conserved and class-distinctive residues along with the period (Teleostei, Amphibian, Mammalian) in which they diverged. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that filamins diverged from a common ancestral gene between urochordate and vertebrate lineages. Filamins also diverged the most just after gene duplication, in the Teleostei period, with filamin C remaining closest to ancestral filamin. At the residue level, domains with well-characterized interfaces, IgFLN 17 and IgFLN 21, have diverged in potentially critical residues in their adhesion protein binding interfaces, signifying that isoforms may bind or regulate ligand binding differentially. Similarly, isoform divergence in a region associated with F-actin binding regulation suggests that isoforms differentially regulate F-actin binding. In addition, we observe some class-distinctive residues in the vicinity of missense mutations that cause filamin A and B associated skeletal disorders. Our analysis, utilizing both spatial and temporal granularity, has identified potentially important residues responsible for vertebrate filamin isoform specific divergence - significantly in regions where few binding partners have been discovered to date - and suggests yet to be discovered filamin binding partners, and isoform specific differential regulation with these binding partners.

When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36 &ndash; 40 repeats, XN1 can readily form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with disease. Many experiments suggest that misfolding of monomeric XN1 plays an important role in the length-dependent aggregation. Elucidating misfolding of XN1 monomer can help determine the molecular mechanism of XN1 aggregation and potentially help develop strategies to inhibit XN1 aggregation. The flanking sequences surrounding the polyQ region can play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of XN1. Few experiments have studied XN1 in its entirety, with all flanking regions. To obtain structural insights into the misfolding of XN1 toward amyloid aggregation, we perform molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions, a variant missing the poly-proline regions, which are hypothesized to prevent aggregation, and an isolated polyQ peptide (Q<sub>n</sub>). For each of these three constructs, we study glutamine repeat lengths of 23, 36, 40 and 47. We find that polyQ peptides have a positive correlation between their probability to form a &beta;-rich misfolded state and their expansion length. We also find that the flanking regions of XN1 affect its probability to form a &beta;-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ. Particularly, the poly-proline regions form polyproline type II helices and decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a &beta;-rich state. Additionally, by lengthening polyQ, the first N-terminal 17 residues are more likely to adopt a &beta;-sheet conformation rather than an &alpha;-helix conformation.

We find that iterative rounds of sequence design and conformational optimization are needed to produce models that have calculated binding energies that are similar to binding energies calculated for native complexes in the protein data bank. We also show that additional conformation sampling with molecular dynamics can be iterated with sequence design to further lower the computed energy of the designed complexes.

We report here that RI deletion enabled &Delta;F508 CFTR to mature and traffic to the cell surface where it mediated regulated anion efflux and exhibited robust single chloride channel activity. Long term pulse-chase experiments showed that the mature &Delta;RI/&Delta;F508 had a T<sub>1/2</sub> of ~14h in cells, similar to the wild-type. RI deletion restored ATP occlusion by NBD1 of &Delta;F508 CFTR and had a strong thermo-stabilizing influence on the channel with gating up to at least 40<sup>o</sup>C. None of these effects of RI removal were achieved by deletion of only portions of RI. Dynamics simulations of NBD1 indicated that RI might indirectly influence the interaction of NBD1 with the rest of the protein by attenuating the coupling of the F508 containing loop with the F1-like ATP-binding core subdomain so that RI removal overcame the perturbations caused by F508 deletion. Restriction of RI to a particular conformational state may ameliorate the impact of the disease-causing mutation.'),(719,'tmd_plso10','Tsao, D., Minton, A. P., and Dokholyan, N.

We demonstrate that one of the haplotypes, carrying the non-synonymous variation known to code for a less stable protein, exhibits increased protein expression in vitro. This increased protein expression, which would compensate for lower protein stability, is solely produced by a synonymous variation (C166T) situated within the haplotype and located in the 5’ region of the RNA transcript.

Our folding simulations of the tertiary mRNA structures demonstrate that destabilization by the T allele lowers the folding transition barrier thus decreasing the probability of occupying its native state.

Here we examine the effect of Cys-111 glutathionylation, a physiologically prevalent post-translational oxidative modification, on the stabilities of wild type SOD1 and two phenotypically diverse FALS mutants, A4V and I112T. Glutathionylation results in profound destabilization of SOD1WT dimers, increasing the equilibrium dissociation constant Kd to ~10-20 μM, comparable to that of the aggressive A4V mutant. SOD1A4V is further destabilized by glutathionylation, experiencing an approximately 30-fold increase in Kd. Dissociation kinetics of glutathionylated SOD1WT and SOD1A4V are unchanged, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, indicating that glutathionylation destabilizes these variants by decreasing association rate. In contrast, SOD1I112T has a modestly increased dissociation rate but no change in Kd when glutathionylated. Using computational structural modeling, we show that the distinct effects of glutathionylation on different SOD1 variants correspond to changes in composition of the dimer interface. Our experimental and computational results show that Cys-111 glutathionylation induces structural rearrangements that modulate stability of both wild type and FALS mutant SOD1.

In order to modulate the function and stability of ABC transporters, detailed knowledge regarding their structure and dynamics is necessary. Recently published atomic resolution X-ray structures of ABC exporter proteins indicate three major conformations, a nucleotide-bound “bottom-closed” state with the two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) tightly closed, and two nucleotide-free conformations, the “bottom-closed” conformation where the NBDs are close to each other, and the “bottom-open” where the two NBDs are widely separated. Since there are experimental indications that a large distance between NBDs is not a requisite for function, it still remains a question how the widely open conformation should be interpreted.  It is questioned whether or not hydrolysis at one of the sites can drive conformational transitions while the NBDs remain in contact.  To extend our knowledge on these questions, we have investigated the dynamic properties of the bacterial Sav1866 transporter in different states using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We have demonstrated that the replacement of ATP by ADP at a nucleotide binding site in the “bottom-closed” holo conformation alters the correlated motion patterns of the NBDs as well as the transmembrane domains (TMD). The results suggest that the hydrolysis of even a single nucleotide could directly lead to extracellular closure, driving the transport cycle. Essential dynamics analysis of simulations suggest that the replacement of one of the ATP molecules can drive the system towards a “bottom-closed” apo conformation similar to that observed in the X-ray structure of the bacterial ABC transporter, MsbA. We have also found significant structural instability of the “bottom-open” form of the transporters in MD simulations.  Our results suggest that ATP hydrolysis at one of the sites promotes transport related conformational changes that do not lead to a “bottom-open” apo conformation, and that the “bottom-closed” conformation is physiologically more relevant for describing the structure of the apo state.'),(744,'tdd_plso11','Tsao, D., Diatchenko, L., and Dokholyan, N.

We have hypothesized that filtering out docking poses recognized as non-native (i.e., pose decoys) should improve the performance of virtual screening in terms of improved identification of true binders. Using several concepts from the field of cheminformatics, we have developed a novel approach to identifying pose decoys from an ensemble of poses generated by computational docking procedures. We demonstrate that the use of pose filters leads to significant improvement of hit rates in virtual screening studies employing a physical force field-based scoring function (MedusaScore) for 12 of the 13 benchmark sets from the clustered version of Database of Useful Decoys (DUD). This new combined scoring function outperforms several conventional structure-based scoring functions, including XSCORE::HMSCORE, ChemScore, PLP, and Chemgauss3, in six out of 13 data sets at early stage of VS (up 1% decoys of the screening database). We compare our method with several VS methods that were recently reported to have good performances on the same DUD data sets. Compared with two ligand-based methods (FieldScreen and FLAP::LBX), we find that the retrieved ligands using our method are chemically more diverse. We also compare our method with FLAP::RBLB, a high-performance VS method that also utilizes both the receptor and the cognate ligand structures. Interestingly, we find that the top ligands retrieved using our method are highly complementary to those retrieved using FLAP::RBLB, hinting effective directions for best VS applications.

In these targets, scoring functions cannot accurately identify the native or near-native binding pose of the ligand from among decoy poses, affecting both the accuracy of the binding affinity prediction and the ability of virtual screening to identify true binders in chemical libraries. Here, we present an approach to discriminate native poses from decoys in difficult targets where several scoring functions failed to correctly identify the native pose. Our approach employs Discrete Molecular Dynamics simulations in order to incorporate protein-ligand dynamics and the entropic effects of binding. We analyze a collection of poses generated by docking and find that the residence time of the ligand in the native and native-like binding poses is distinctly longer than that in decoy poses. This finding suggests that molecular simulations offer a unique approach to distinguishing the native (or native-like) binding pose from decoys that cannot be accomplished with scoring functions evaluating static structures.

The fibrillar aggregates formed by wildtype and various disease-associated mutants have recently been found to have distinct cores and morphologies. Previous computational and experimental studies of wildtype SOD1 suggest that the apo-monomer, highly aggregation-prone, displays substantial local unfolding dynamics. The residual folded structure of locally unfolded apoSOD1 corresponds to peptide segments forming the aggregation core as identified by a combination of proteolysis and mass spectroscopy. Therefore, we hypothesize that the destabilization of apoSOD1 caused by various mutations leads to distinct local unfolding dynamics. The partially unfolded structure, exposing the hydrophobic core and backbone hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, is prone to aggregate. The peptide segments in the residual folded structures form the “building block” for aggregation, which in turn determines the morphology of the aggregates. To test this hypothesis, we apply a multiscale simulation approach to study the aggregation of three typical SOD1 variants: wildtype, G37R, and I149T. Each of these SOD1 variants has distinct peptide segments forming the core structure and features different aggregate morphologies. We perform atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the conformational dynamics of apoSOD1 monomer, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study the aggregation of partially unfolded SOD1 monomers. Our computational studies of monomer local unfolding and the aggregation of different SOD1 variants are consistent with experiments, supporting the hypothesis of the formation of aggregation “building blocks” via apo-monomer local unfolding as the mechanism of SOD1 fibrillar aggregation.

PHD2 malfunctions due to protein misfolding may be the underlying reason of metastasis and invasion in such cases.  In this study, we scrutinize the unfolding pathways of the PHD2 catalytic domain’s possible species and demonstrate the properties of their unfolding states by computational approaches.

Prior work from our laboratory has emphasized both the overall accuracy of this approach and the need for nuanced interpretation of some apparent discrepancies between modeled and accepted structures. Recent studies [Kladwang et al., Biochemistry 50:8049 (2011) and Nat. Chem. 3:954 (2011)] yielded poorer RNA secondary structure predictions than expected based on prior benchmarking efforts. To understand the features that led to these divergent results, we re-examined four RNAs yielding the poorest results in this recent work – tRNAPhe, adenine and di-cyclic-GMP riboswitches, and 5S rRNA. For two RNAs, tRNAPhe and the adenine riboswitch, secondary structure predictions are nearly perfect if no experimental information is included but were rendered inaccurate by the Kladwang et al. SHAPE data. An additional focus of the recent work was to compare SHAPE-directed structure prediction with the mutate-and-map method, the latter providing an information-rich view of RNA interactions by obtaining SHAPE profiles for hundreds of RNA variants. When best practices and identical RNAs were used, single-sequence SHAPE prediction of canonical base pairs was nearly indistinguishable from the mutate-and-map approach with the exception of a single helix in the 5S rRNA. SHAPE-directed secondary structure modeling recovered ~93% of individual base pairs and greater than 90% of helices in the four RNAs. The field of experimentally-directed RNA secondary structure prediction is entering a phase focused on the most difficult prediction challenges: We outline five constructive principles for guiding this field forward.'),(770,'hkacjdr_fasebj13','He, L., Kota, P., Aleksandrov, A.

The compound also promoted maturation of several disease-associated processing mutants on the CL4 side of this interface.

A major impediment towards understanding the non-templating roles is the absence of high content structural information for TER within the telomerase complex. Here, we used selective 2-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) to examine the structure of Tetrahymena TER free in solution and bound to tTERT in the minimal telomerase RNP. We discovered a striking difference in the two conformations and established direct evidence for base pair triples in the tTER pseudoknot.

Covarying networks of residues that tend to cluster on the protein surface and near binding sites have been identified in some proteins. However, the underlying role these networks play in the protein resulting in their conservation remains unclear in most cases. Resolving their role is crucial, because residues in these networks are not viable design targets if their role is to maintain the fold of the protein.

Here, we identify networks of evolutionarily-related residues in C-class antibody domains by evaluating covariation, a measure of propensity with which residue pairs vary dependently during evolution. We computationally test whether mutation of residues in these networks affects stability of the folded antibody domain, determining their viability as design candidates. We find that members of covarying networks cluster at domain-domain interfaces, and that mutations to these residues are diverse and frequent during evolution, precluding their importance to domain stability.

Although disordered proteins are crucial in many biological processes and designing strategies to modulate their function is highly important, both experimental and computational tools to describe their conformational ensembles and the initial steps of folding are sparse. Here we report that discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) simulations combined with replica exchange (RX) method efficiently samples the conformational space and detects regions populating a-helical conformational states in disordered protein regions. While the available computational methods predict secondary structural propensities in IDPs based on the observation of protein-protein interactions, our ab initio method rests on physical principles of protein folding and dynamics. We show that RX-DMD predicts a-PreSMos with high confidence confirmed by comparison to experimental NMR data. Moreover, the method also can dissect a-PreSMos in close vicinity to each other and indicate helix stability. Importantly, simulations with disordered regions forming helices in X-ray structures of complexes indicate that a preformed helix is frequently the binding element itself, while in other cases it may have a role in initiating the binding process.

We observe a stable pore structure on timescales of 0.2 ms, with multiple cations occupying the selectivity filter and cytosolic vestibule, but not the inner chamber. We further suggest that stability of the selectivity filter critically depends on the interactions between the I4897 residue and several hydrophobic residues of the neighboring subunit.

Although VX-770 has demonstrated substantial clinical efficacy in the small subset of patients with a mutation (G551D) that affects only channel activity, a single compound is not sufficient to treat patients with the more common CFTR mutation, ΔF508. Thus, patients with ΔF508 will likely require treatment with both correctors and potentiators to achieve clinical benefit. However, whereas the effectiveness of acute treatment with this drug combination has been demonstrated in vitro, the impact of chronic therapy has not been established. In studies of human primary airway epithelial cells, we found that both acute and chronic treatment with VX-770 improved CFTR function in cells with the G551D mutation, consistent with clinical studies. In contrast, chronic VX-770 administration caused a dose-dependent reversal of VX-809-mediated CFTR correction in ΔF508 homozygous cultures. This result reflected the destabilization of corrected ΔF508 CFTR by VX-770, dramatically increasing its turnover rate. Chronic VX-770 treatment also reduced mature wild- type CFTR levels and function. These findings demonstrate that chronic treatment with CFTR potentiators and correctors may have unexpected effects that cannot be predicted from short-term studies.

These cleavage events are partially regulated by intracellular signaling through an unknown allosteric mechanism. Here we show that the intracellular N-terminus of γ-ENaC undergoes secondary structural transitions upon interaction with phosphoinositides. From ab initio folding simulations of the N-termini in the presence and absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2 or PIP2) we found that PIP2 increases alpha-helical propensity in the N-terminus of γ-ENaC.

We also show that conditions that decrease PIP2 or enhance ubiquitination sharply limit access of the γ-ENaC extracellular domain to proteases. Further, the efficiency of allosteric control of ENaC proteolysis is dependent on Tyr370 in γ-ENaC.

Using quantum mechanics/discrete molecular dynamics, we showed that both Zn-less wild-type (WT)-SOD1 and its D124N mutant that does not bind Zn have at least metastable folded states. In those states, the reduction potential of Cu increases, leading to the presence of detectable amounts of Cu(I) instead of Cu(II) in the active site, as confirmed experimentally. The Cu(I) protein cannot participate in the catalytic Cu(I)–Cu(II) cycle. However, even without the full reduction to Cu(I), the Cu site in the Zn-less variants of SOD1 is shown to be catalytically incompetent: unable to bind superoxide in a way comparable to the WT-SOD1. The changes are more radical and different in the D124N Zn-less mutant than in the Zn-less WT-SOD1, suggesting D124N being perhaps not the most adequate model for Zn-less SOD1. Overall, Zn in SOD1 appears to be influencing the Cu site directly by adjusting its reduction potential and geometry.

Superoxide, which has multiple signaling functions, is a by-product of the p-side quinol oxidation. Although the transmembrane core and the chemistry of quinone redox reactions are conserved in bc complexes, the rate of superoxide generation is an order of magnitude greater in the b6f complex, implying that functionally significant differences in structure exist between the b6f and bc1 complexes on the p-side. A unique structure feature of the b6f p-side quinol oxidation site is the presence of a single chlorophyll-a molecule whose function is unrelated to light harvesting. This study describes a cocrystal structure of the cytochrome b6f complex with the quinol analog stigmatellin, which partitions in the Qp portal of the bc1 complex, but not effectively in b6f. It is inferred that the Qp portal is partially occluded in the b6f complex relative to bc1. Based on a discrete molecular-dynamics analysis, occlusion of the Qp portal is attributed to the presence of the chlorophyll phytyl tail, which increases the quinone residence time within the Qp portal and is inferred to be a cause of enhanced superoxide production. This study attributes a novel (to our knowledge), structure-linked function to the otherwise enigmatic chlorophyll-a in the b6f complex, which may also be relevant to intracellular redox signaling.'),(803,'htrddw_bc14','Homan, P., Tandon, A., Rice, G.

This study elucidates the mechanism underlying the H2AX-dependent regulation of DNA-PKcs in ionizing radiation-induced, differential DDR, and derives an unconventional, non-catalytic domain target in DNA-PKs for overcoming resistance during cancer radiotherapy.'),(815,'mpgcadjdm_jp15','Martin, L.

The question is then if/how this protein search is amenable to selection and biological control? To shed light on this issue, we examined the motions of three evolutionary divergent proteins in the E. coli cytoplasm by in-cell NMR. The results show that the diffusive in-cell motions, after all, follows simplistic physical-chemical rules: the proteins reveal a common dependence on (i) net-charge density, (ii) surface hydrophobicity and (iii) the electric dipole moment. The bacterial protein is here biased to move relatively freely in the bacterial interior, whereas the human counterparts more easily stick. Even so, the in- cell motions respond predictably to surface mutation, allowing us to tune and intermix the protein’s behaviour at will. The findings show how evolution can swiftly optimise the diffuse background of protein-encounter complexes by just single point mutations, and provide a rational framework for adjusting the cytoplasmic motions of individual proteins, e.g. for rescuing poor in-cell NMR signals and for optimising protein therapeutics.'),(843,'bppdb_sa17','Brodie, N.

The folding energy landscape of an RNA is highly dependent on its nucleotide sequence and molecular environment. Cellular molecules sometimes alter the energy landscape, thereby changing the ensemble of likely low-energy conformations. The effects of these energy landscape changes on the conformational ensemble are particularly challenging to visualize for large RNAs. We have created a robust approach for visualizing the conformational ensemble of RNAs that is well-suited for <i>in vitro</i> vs. <i>in vivo</i> comparisons. <br> Method: Our method creates a stable map of conformational space for a given RNA sequence. We first identify single point mutations in the RNA that maximally sample suboptimal conformational space based on the ensemble\'s partition function. Then, we cluster these diverse ensembles to identify the most diverse partition functions for Boltzmann stochastic sampling. By using a novel nestedness distance metric, we iteratively add mutant suboptimal ensembles to converge on a stable 2-dimensional map of conformational space. We then compute the SHAPE-directed ensemble for the RNA folding under different conditions, and we project these ensembles on the map to visualize. <br>Results: To validate our approach, we established a conformational map of the Vibrio vunificus add adenine riboswitch that reveals five classes of structures.

However, incomplete 3D structural information on the unique ABC ion channel, CFTR, hinders elucidation of its functional mechanism and correction of cystic fibrosis causing mutants. Several CFTR homology models have been developed using bacterial ABC transporters as templates but these have low sequence similarity to CFTR and are not ion channels. Here, we refine an earlier model in an outward (OWF) and develop an inward (IWF) facing model employing an integrated experimental-molecular dynamics simulation (200 ns) approach. Our IWF structure agrees well with a recently solved cryo-EM structure of a CFTR IWF state. We utilize cysteine cross-linking to verify positions and orientations of residues within trans-membrane helices (TMHs) of the OWF conformation and to reconstruct a physiologically relevant pore structure. Comparison of pore profiles of the two conformations reveal a radius sufficient to permit passage of hydrated Cl- ions in the OWF but not the IWF model. To identify structural determinants that distinguish the two conformations and possible rearrangements of TMHs within them responsible for channel gating, we perform cross-linking by bifunctional reagents of multiple predicted pairs of cysteines in TMH 6 and 12 and 6 and 9. To determine whether the effects of cross-linking on gating observed are the result of switching of the channel from open to close state, we also treat the same residue pairs with monofunctional reagents in separate experiments.

AD-related cellular dysfunctions have been linked to this ApoE4 misfolded state. In this regard, it has been reported that the mutation R61T is able to rescue the deleterious cellular effects of ApoE4 by preventing the formation of the misfolded intermediate state. However, a clear description of the structural features at the basis of the R61T-ApoE4 mutant’s protective effect is still missing. Recently, using extensive molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified a structural model of an ApoE4 misfolded intermediate state. Building on our previous work, here, we explore the dynamical changes induced by the R61T mutation in the ApoE4 native and misfolded states. Notably, we do not observe any local changes in the domains in the R61T-ApoE4 system, rather a general loss of correlated movements in the entire protein structure. More specifically, we detect increased dynamics in the hinge region, which is essential for ApoE4 domain-domain interaction. Consistent with previously reported data on altered phospholipid and receptor binding, we hypothesize that mutations destabilizing the ApoE4 intermediate state change hinge region dynamics which propagates to distal functional regions of the protein and modifies ApoE4’s functional properties.
